## About
I am a PhD student at [Machine Vision Lab](https://balarsgroup.github.io/), IIT Roorkee, where I work under [Prof. R.Balasubramanian](https://sites.google.com/site/balaiitr/) in the field of Computer Vision and Deep Learning. My research interest includes Multimodal Human Activity Recognition using RGB, depth, sensor and infrared data.
